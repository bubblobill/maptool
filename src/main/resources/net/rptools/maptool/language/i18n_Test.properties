  <p> Each sight type can have zero or more options, use spaces between each option.  Having zero options implies using \
  defaults for all values (e.g. Normal vision).</p>\
  <p><b>  Options:</b></p>\
  <dl>\
    <dt>shape</dt><dd>shape may be circle, square, hex, grid, cone or beam</dd>\
    <dt>distance=y</dt><dd>Distance is the range at which this vision type ends. Can be a decimal value, e.g. distance=10.5</dd>\
    <dt>scale</dt><dd>An optional keyword that adds the token's footprint (size) to the distance so vision starts at token's edge vs the token's center.</dd>\
    <dt>arc=y</dt><dd>Used with the cone shape. The angle of the cone in degrees, it determines the field of view the token has. Can be an integer value, e.g. arc=120</dd>\
    <dt>width=y</dt><dd>Used with the beam shape. How wide the beam will be in map units. Can be a decimal, e.g. width=1.4</dd>\
    <dt>offset=y</dt><dd>Used with the cone and beam shape. For cones, how many degrees off center the shape begins; for beams, how many degrees off center to the center-line of the beam. Can be an integer value, e.g. offset=120</dd>\
    <dt>x#</dt><dd>Magnifier, multiplies each light source radius by this value. Can be a decimal value, e.g. x2.5</dd>\
    <dt>r#</dt><dd><p>Range of personal light. The token will have a light source centered on them that only they can see with a radius of this value. You can define multiple personal lights per sight type.</p>\
                   <p>Can have an optional #rrggbb hex color component appended to it as per typical CSS rules.</p>\
                   <p>Can also have an optional +x lumens value. Lumens defaults to 100, meaning it will see through any darkness with a lumens value from -1 to -99. See discussion of lumens on the Light tab for more info.</p>\
